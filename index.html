    <h2>Primal Yoga</h2>
    <p>
      Primal Mvmntâ„¢ (formerly Primal Yoga), founded by Liz, is a dynamic yoga and martial arts fusion style that seamlessly blends the Vinyasa style of yoga with the artistry of Kung Fu and the grace of Tai Chi, creating a harmonious dance of balance, strength, and synergy in your physical and emotional bodies.

    <h2>BJJ</h2>
    <p>
      On the surface, BJJ simply stands for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, that is just the definition of the acronym. If you peel back the layers, you will find that in a world of armbars, triangle chokes, and kimuras, BJJ takes on a deeper meaning to the athletes who practice "the gentle art."</p>

    <a href="#" class="link-medium">This is how you really do it</a>

    <h2>Relaxing Music</h2>
    <p>
      Lofi hip hop (also known as chillhop and lofi beats to study to) is a form of downtempo music that combines elements of hip hop and chill-out music. It was popularized in the 2010s on YouTube.
